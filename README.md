# COMP-541-Data_mining_project
# Personalized Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project involves the development of a data-driven movie recommendation system using content-based filtering. The system is designed to analyze user data and provide personalized movie suggestions, thereby enhancing user experience and engagement on the platform.

## Implementation
The recommendation system is implemented using advanced machine learning algorithms. These algorithms analyze user behavior and movie characteristics to generate recommendations. The goal is to provide users with movie suggestions that align with their preferences and viewing history.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
A comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing phase was conducted using statistical methods, correlation heatmaps, and word clouds. These techniques were used to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This rigorous data preparation phase ensured that the data was well-understood and ready for effective modeling. As a result, the system is able to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Performance Evaluation
The system's performance was evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as F1 score, recall, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics provided a quantitative measure of the system's accuracy and effectiveness. The analysis and subsequent optimization led to significant improvements in the recommendation accuracy and overall system performance.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the use of data mining and machine learning to create a personalized movie recommendation system. The system's ability to provide accurate and personalized movie suggestions enhances user experience and engagement, making it a valuable tool for movie streaming platforms.

## Future Work
Future work will focus on further improving the recommendation accuracy and expanding the system to include other forms of content, such as TV shows and documentaries.
